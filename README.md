Browser plugin for streaming movies via IMDB through the VoDlocker.to API

At the moment, this is merely a proof of concept and there are plenty of bugs and design issues.
The plugin embeds movies from the VoDlocker.to API to movies found on IMDB. The plugin currently only supports movies (altough the API has support for series as well) and will therefore generate errors if tried on anything other than movies.
All content is sourced from vodlocker.to via their API.
